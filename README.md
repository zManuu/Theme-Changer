# Theme-Changer
In order for an element of your website<br>
to be changed when the<br>
theme is changed, you must add the<br>
class "themeChanger" to these elements.

To create a change button, it must execute the<br>
method "nextTheme()" when clicked. The button<br>
in the example looks like this:<br>
"[button class="themeChanger" onclick="nextTheme()" id="changeButton"] Change theme [/button]".<br>
Just replace "[" with "<" and "]" with ">" and your<br>
button should change the theme when clicked!

To change the colors (default: white & black) to your custom colors,<br>
edit the colors array in "script.js" (line 18) as you want.
