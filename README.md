# Change-theme button
<br >

To create a change button, it must execute the<br>
method "nextTheme()" when clicked. The button<br>
in the example looks like this:<br>
"[button class="themeChanger" onclick="nextTheme()" id="changeButton"] Change theme [/button]".<br>
Just replace "[" with "<" and "]" with ">" and your<br>
button should change the theme when clicked!
